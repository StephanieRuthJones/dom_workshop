            There's no better place to lose yourself in nature than in
            springtime New Hampshire. As serene and beautiful as it was in the
            1700s, this state is still much less traveled than its neighbors to
            the South. So enjoy it while it lasts.

            You won't be on your bike the whole time, so doesn't it make sense
            to pick up some extra footwear? Fortunately for you, the best
            outdoor shoe company in the history of the world proudly hails from
            this state. Cycle by the Timberland headquarters in Stratham, and
            pick up a pair of rugged, waterproof boots to keep your feet dry.
            Fitting for unpredictable weather you may be confronted by while
            passing through the Appalachians. These boots are also better than
            cycling shoes when pitching a tent.
          </p>
          <p class="text__paragraph">Average cost: $100-150.</p>
