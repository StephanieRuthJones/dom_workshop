## Assessment Instructions
To complete this assessment, you will use the array of animal objects and DOM manipulation to display a set of animal cards in your browser. 

- [ ] Start app
- [ ] Open dev console to view `animal` data
- [ ] Change the text of all the links in the nav to red
- [ ] Select the **cards container** `div` by its `class`
- [ ] Iterate over the array of animal data
- [ ] For each animal, use DOM manipulation to create a card that meets the following requirements:
    - [ ] The card's contents are contained by a parent `div` element with a `class` attribute of `card` as well as a `style` attribute that sets the card's `width` to `18rem`
    - [ ] Card has an **image element** with attributes, including a `class` of `card-img-top`, `src` of the **animal's image url**
    - [ ] Card has a child `div` with a `class` of `card-body`
    - [ ] In the card's body, there is a **heading element** with a `class` of `card-title` and the animal's name as text
    - [ ] Below the **card title**, there is a **paragraph element** that displays the animal's **description**
